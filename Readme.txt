A game built using Pygame. The user tries to eat as many apples as possible while not hitting the edge of the screen or bitting the worm's body. 

This is the first game I built with Pygame and I have adapted it from Al Sweigart's Wormy game in his book "Making Games with Python & Pygame". 

Feel free to copy, modify or play this game.

Features:
 - improved UI
 - tracks high score 
 - pause mode
